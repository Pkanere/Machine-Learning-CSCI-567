# K-Means Clustering

- Implemented K-means clustering algorithm to identify clusters in a two-dimensional toy-dataset
- Implemented image compression using K-means clustering algorithm
- Implemented classification using the centroids identified by clustering on digits dataset
- Implemented K-means++ clustering algorithm to identify clusters in a two-dimensional toy-dataset i.e. implement the kmeans++ function to compute the centers
