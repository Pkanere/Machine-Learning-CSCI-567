# Neural Networks

- Implemented Multi-layer Perceptron network to classify MNIST database of handwritten digits (0-9)
- Mini-batch gradient descent which is a gradient-based optimization was used to learn the parameters of the neural network
- Dropout regularization was implemented for reducing overfitting
