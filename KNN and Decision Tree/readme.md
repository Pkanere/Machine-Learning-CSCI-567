# K Nearest Neighbour

- Implemented KNN for binary classification of give dataset
- Implemented two different data transformation approached - Normalizing the feature vector and Min-max scaling
- Comparedthe accuracy of model for four different distacne functions - euclidean_distance, inner_product_distance, gaussian_kernel_distance and cosine distance
