# K Nearest Neighbour

- Implemented KNN for binary classification of given dataset
- Implemented two different data transformation approached - Normalizing the feature vector and Min-max scaling
- Compared the accuracy of model for four different distance functions - euclidean distance, inner product distance, gaussian kernel distance and cosine distance

# Decision Tree

- Implemented ID3 algorithm for classification of given dataset
- Implemented post-pruning to avoid overfitting
